Bachelor of Biomedical Science graduates need to demonstrate a well-developed understanding of the biomedical science sub-disciplines to enable them to undertake values driven problem solving. Application of their knowledge, understanding and skills to local and global issues must attend to both First Peoples and Western perspectives, and these aspects are embedded within specified biomedical science units in all years. Employers are seeking students with recognised transferable skills (e.g. team work, communication skills, problem-solving ability, and care for others) and the Biomedical Science degree at ACU integrates development of these skills into its units, driving the development of graduates with a high emotional intelligence, adaptability and resilience. Overall, the Bachelor of Biomedical Science aims to prepare ethical graduates with a concern for the common good, who are able to apply a broad and coherent body of knowledge to undertake professional work in a range of biomedical science contexts and as a basis for life-long learning. These graduates will often collaborate within health care teams to create novel solutions to global and national health challenges.

In Australia, there are employment opportunities in professional and semi-professional sporting teams, Australian and state institutes of sport, academies of sport, and other sporting organisations. These opportunities extend to the international market. At the heart of this industry is the conditioning of the athlete, with the aim of optimising individual and team performance for successful outcomes. A professional working in this industry needs to know about testing protocols to assess athlete performance, principles of strength and conditioning, the technologies available for monitoring and training athletes, and the relationships between nutrition, injury and performance. The application of this knowledge and understanding to the planning and delivery of meaningful interventions for athletes to enhance performance and reduce the likelihood of injury and illness is essential for a professional working in the high performance sport environment. The Bachelor of High Performance Sport degree provides an extensive knowledge and skills base relevant to human performance, from the physiological, psychological, biomechanical, nutritional and skill-based perspectives.

Students will also gain knowledge of the macro and micro sociological forces, including social movements that have impacted historically on political, economic, cultural and ecological conditions,  resulting in extreme poverty, poor health, fragile governance, inequality and environmental vulnerability. The degree grounds students in qualitative and quantitative research methods, providing them with the skills and knowledge to be able to determine appropriate strength-based capacity building approaches, and to identify economic inclusion strategies that promote economic opportunities for marginalised communities.

Exercise scientists working with clinical populations and high performance athletes will benefit from the knowledge and skills gained from many core topics within psychology, including motivation, emotion, individual differences, psychological disorders, and decision making. ACU's undergraduate psychology programs help students to acquire knowledge, assimilate conceptual understandings and develop skills of application that are valuable to the enhancement of human functioning in a broad range of professional settings. Graduates of the Bachelor of Psychological Science will complete a sequence in psychology that is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC). This sequence will ensure graduates acquire an advanced understanding of human behaviour, as well as highly regarded employability skills, including: The Bachelor of Exercise and Sports Science progresses students from foundation knowledge, understanding and skills in human anatomy, physiology and the sub-disciplines of Exercise Science, into their application in movement, exercise and sporting contexts, such as exercise testing, prescription and delivery. Students are then progressed into authentic learning experiences in which they can integrate their evidence-based learnings and scope of practice in applied, industry-based settings. This professional practice provides students with the opportunity to reflect upon their transition from learning to practitioner. The course has qualifying accreditation status with Exercise and Sports Science Australia.
