Bachelor of Biomedical Science graduates need to demonstrate a well-developed understanding of the biomedical science sub-disciplines to enable them to undertake values driven problem solving. Application of their knowledge, understanding and skills to local and global issues must attend to both First Peoples and Western perspectives, and these aspects are embedded within specified biomedical science units in all years. Employers are seeking students with recognised transferable skills (e.g. team work, communication skills, problem-solving ability, and care for others) and the Biomedical Science degree at ACU integrates development of these skills into its units, driving the development of graduates with a high emotional intelligence, adaptability and resilience. Overall, the Bachelor of Biomedical Science aims to prepare ethical graduates with a concern for the common good, who are able to apply a broad and coherent body of knowledge to undertake professional work in a range of biomedical science contexts and as a basis for life-long learning. These graduates will often collaborate within health care teams to create novel solutions to global and national health challenges. Students undertake specified units in years 1 and 2 of the degree, year 3 of the program provides some flexibility in terms of industry based placements and elective units."

In Australia, there are employment opportunities in professional and semi-professional sporting teams, Australian and state institutes of sport, academies of sport, and other sporting organisations. These opportunities extend to the international market. At the heart of this industry is the conditioning of the athlete, with the aim of optimising individual and team performance for successful outcomes. A professional working in this industry needs to know about testing protocols to assess athlete performance, principles of strength and conditioning, the technologies available for monitoring and training athletes, and the relationships between nutrition, injury and performance. The application of this knowledge and understanding to the planning and delivery of meaningful interventions for athletes to enhance performance and reduce the likelihood of injury and illness is essential for a professional working in the high performance sport environment. The Bachelor of High Performance Sport degree provides an extensive knowledge and skills base relevant to human performance, from the physiological, psychological, biomechanical, nutritional and skill-based perspectives. This provides not only the skills for professional practice in sports performance and analysis, exercise programming, and the strength and conditioning of athletes, but also the skills for applying exercise prescription principles across the lifespan for healthy lifestyles and in injury and disease. The course aims to produce graduates with strong understanding and skills for the assessment, design and delivery of meaningful programs that enhance athletic performance and reduce the likelihood of injury and illness, using appropriate techniques to analyse and interpret competition and training information, required in high performance sport and related industries. Graduates should also have the capacity to apply their knowledge and skills in an ethical, fair and respectful manner, with problem solving and self-management skills that promote independent learning and thinking, and the pursuit of further learning to maintain relevance in their chosen career and industry."

Nutritionists create opportunities for people to learn about food and nutrition, design food products to support a healthy diet, influence food systems to foster sustainability, and advocate for a safe and equitable food supply across the globe. Studies in nutrition therefore include the science behind food and nutrition – biology and human physiology and chemistry and biochemistry, food and culinary nutrition science and the role of food and nutrition in health promotion and disease prevention. Nutrition links very closely with the national and global health priorities related to overnutrition and risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, much of which is preventable through a healthy lifestyle. ACU's program focuses on nutrition for general health, with understanding of the role of food and nutrition in chronic disease management, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nutrition related health and community and public health priorities. ACU is the only university in Australia to offer students the opportunity to focus their study on culinary nutrition, an emerging area for work in the food and nutrition industry. The degree will appeal to anyone interested in a career as a nutritionists in public health and policy, in culinary nutrition science, in food and nutrition education and communication, in food science and technology, and in the research and food product development sectors. Work placement units provide students with eposure to work settings where they may gain employment following graduation and international short term study offers students the chance to enrich their university learning experience. The program also provides the basis for postgraduate studies in dietetics. Dietitians treat disease through diet and therefore require additional studies and clinical practice in health settings."
