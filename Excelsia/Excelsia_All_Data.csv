As a primary teacher you’ll share in laughter, mop up tears, tie shoelaces, celebrate success and show how to learn from mistakes. You’ll ignite imaginations, encourage curiosity and provide the tools for academic achievement, but you’ll also play a critical role in imparting life lessons – how to be a kind, respectful and successful person, not only in the classroom, but in the schoolyard, at home and in the world.
Nelson Mandela was right when he said ‘education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world’ – you may spend a short time teaching a child, but the effects can last a lifetime. The Master of Teaching (Primary) is designed for people with a love of learning and a love of children. It takes commitment, empathy, negotiation, motivation, passion, problem-solving and understanding.
